University project about a Recommender System in tourist domain.

You are a tourist information office that wants to suggest their registered users the next destination to visit. A lot of users have registered on your platform and they check-in places they have visited. These places are of any sorts and do not contain only historical landmarks. They can be anything from restaurants to interesting locations in a city. Instead of asking directly at your offices, visitors want to see where their friends have been electronically. Hence, they might want to go and visit these places confirming their common interests with their peers. Your goal is to design and test a Recommender System in the tourism domain.
